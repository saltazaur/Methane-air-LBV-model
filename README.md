# Methane-air-LBV-model
The objective was to introduce a new laminar burning velocity model for methane-air mixture as a function of initial pressure, temperature and equivalence ratio based on machine learning algorithms using experimental data collected from literature. 

The models will be posted, when the paper "Methane-air laminar burning velocity predictions with machine learning algorithms" is published.
